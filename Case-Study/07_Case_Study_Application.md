# 07. Part VII: Case Study Application: Emergency CT Scan Approval System

## 7.1 Scenario Implementation

This case study illustrates the impact of the Fairness Audit Playbook on a critical system component: **Emergency CT Scan Approval**.

| Metric/Observation | Before Implementation | After Implementation | Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Average Approval Time** | 90 minutes | 15 minutes | **75-minute reduction**, leading to timely care. |
| **GP Request Rejection Rate** | 65% | <15% (Matches Surgeon Rate) | **Eliminated requester-based bias** in emergency cases. |
| **Limited Premium Disparity** | 30% lower approval rates | <5% difference | **Achieved coverage equity** for emergency medical need. |
| **Patient Outcome** | Delayed care, potential adverse events | Timely access to necessary care | **Improved patient safety and care quality.** |

## 7.2 Lessons Learned

### Key Success Factors

1.  **Clinical Leadership Engagement:** Essential for defining appropriate, medically-sound fairness criteria and gaining buy-in from providers.
2.  **Multi-Stakeholder Approach:** Including patients, providers, and payers in solution design ensures a holistic, practical, and ethical outcome.
3.  **Data-Driven Implementation:** Using statistical rigor to validate improvements and avoid relying on anecdotal evidence.
4.  **Continuous Monitoring:** Establishing ongoing oversight to prevent fairness regression after initial fixes are implemented.

### Common Challenges

1.  **Conflicting Stakeholder Priorities:** Balancing the insurance operations' need for cost control with the ethical imperative for equitable access.
2.  **Technical Integration:** Modifying legacy EHR and claims processing systems without disrupting critical operations.
3.  **Change Management:** Ensuring staff (case managers, IT) fully adopt and execute the new, fair approval practices.
4.  **Regulatory Complexity:** Navigating overlapping and sometimes conflicting healthcare regulations while driving innovation in fairness.

## ðŸ“š Appendices (Reference)

For detailed implementation code, legal frameworks, communication templates, and training materials, refer to the full Playbook documentation which includes:

## Appendix A: Core Metrics Templates

### A.1 Key Functions

| Function | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `statistical_parity_difference(approvals, requester_type)` | Measures approval rate disparity between groups |
| `equal_opportunity_difference(approvals, necessity, requester_type)` | Measures disparity for necessary cases only |
| `clinical_similarity(case_a, case_b)` | Tests individual fairness between similar patients |

### A.2 Bootstrap Validation

```python
from fairness_metrics import statistical_parity_difference, bootstrap_fairness_ci

# Load data and calculate confidence interval
data = generate_fairness_data(n_samples=10000)
lower_ci, upper_ci = bootstrap_fairness_ci(
    data=data,
    metric_func=statistical_parity_difference,
    metric_args=['approved', 'requester_type'],
    n_iterations=1000
)
print(f"95% CI: [{lower_ci:.4f}, {upper_ci:.4f}]")
```

## Appendix B: Regulatory Framework

| Regulation | Key Requirement |
|------------|-----------------|
| Non-Discrimination Laws | Audit bias in protected groups |
| GDPR Article 22 | Provide decision logic explanation |
| HIPAA | Secure handling of sensitive data |
| FDA/EU AI Act | Document model safety and bias-free operation |

## Appendix C: Communication Templates

### C.1 Audit Alert Template
**Subject:** Fairness Finding - [Model Name] - SPD: [0.118]

**Summary:** Disparity found between [GP vs Surgeon] approval rates.
- Disadvantaged group rate: [0.632]  
- Privileged group rate: [0.750]
- 95% CI: [[0.0588, 0.1779]] - confirms systemic issue

**Action Required:** Root-cause analysis within 7 days.

### C.2 Compliance Report Template
**Status:** RED/AMBER/GREEN

**Finding:** SPD remains high (â‰ˆ0.12) while EOD acceptable (<0.02).

**Action:** Investigating Priority Score feature impact. Remediation Q3.
