# 01. Part I: Historical Context Assessment

## 1.1 Domain-Specific Historical Analysis

**Objective:** Identify historical patterns of discrimination and bias in healthcare insurance approval systems.

### Healthcare Insurance Historical Patterns

| Category | Key Historical Issues Identified |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Administrative Gatekeeping** | Historical preference for specialist-initiated requests over primary care physician (GP) requests. |
| **Premium-Based Discrimination** | Differential approval rates based on insurance tier (limited vs. full premium coverage). |
| **Geographic Disparities** | Rural vs. urban access differences in emergency care approvals. |
| **Procedural Bias** | Complex approval workflows that disadvantage time-sensitive medical situations. |

### Historical Context Assessment Checklist

- [ ] **Administrative Bias Patterns**
    - Review historical approval data by request originator (GP vs. specialist).
    - Identify cases where procedural requirements conflicted with clinical urgency.
    - Document patient outcome impacts from delayed approvals.
- [ ] **Coverage-Based Disparities**
    - Analyze approval rates by premium level (limited vs. full coverage).
    - Examine wait times for different coverage tiers.
    - Map correlation between coverage type and demographic characteristics.
- [ ] **Systemic Access Barriers**
    - Document policy restrictions that create unequal access to urgent care.
    - Identify compound disadvantages (e.g., limited premium + rural location + GP submission).
    - Review historical patient advocacy complaints and legal challenges.
