## 5.1 Audit Workflow

The fairness audit is structured as a four-phase, systematic process:

| Phase | Duration | Key Activities | Deliverable |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Pre-Audit Setup** | Week 1 | Data collection, system documentation, stakeholder engagement. | Audit Scoping Document |
| **2. Historical Context Analysis** | Week 2 | Execute Historical Context Assessment and Bias Source Identification (Parts I & III). | Audit Report Section 1 |
| **3. Baseline Fairness Measurement** | Week 3 | Implement Group/Individual/Intersectional Fairness Metrics (Part IV). | Baseline Fairness Dashboard |
| **4. Root Cause Analysis** | Week 4 | Map disparities to bias sources, conduct stakeholder interviews, develop intervention recommendations. | Final Intervention Plan |

## 5.2 Intervention Framework

### Immediate Actions (0-30 days)

* **Policy Revision:**
    * Remove requester role as a primary approval criterion for emergency cases.
    * Implement a **"clinical justification first"** review process.
* **Threshold Adjustment:**
    * Calibrate approval thresholds to be consistent across all request originators and premium levels for emergency procedures.
* **Training Updates:**
    * Retrain case managers on **equity-focused approval criteria** and bias awareness.

### Medium-term Changes (1-3 months)

* **Algorithm Modification:**
    * Retrain models with **fairness constraints** (e.g., equal opportunity regularization).
    * Add intersectional monitoring capabilities.
* **Process Reengineering:**
    * Streamline emergency approval workflows.
    * Implement real-time fairness monitoring dashboards.
* **System Integration:**
    * Modify EHR interfaces to **emphasize clinical factors** over administrative data points in the approval process.

### Long-term Monitoring (Ongoing)

* **Continuous Monitoring:** Monthly fairness metric reporting and quarterly intersectional analysis.
* **Stakeholder Feedback:** Regular patient outcome tracking, provider satisfaction surveys, and legal/compliance reviews.
